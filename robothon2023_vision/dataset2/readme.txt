Welcome to the "dataset" folder. This folder contains the image dataset that can be used to train a keypoint regression model.

The images within the folder should be named following this format: "frame"_progressive_number.png. 
For example, the first frame should be named "frame_1.png", the second "frame_2.png", and so on.

It is recommended to use images of uniform size to ensure consistency in model training. 

Good luck with training your model!
