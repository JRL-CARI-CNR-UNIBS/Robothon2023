Welcome to the "labels" folder. This folder will contain a YAML file that contains the keypoint labels for the images in the "dataset" folder.

The YAML file inside the "labels" folder should contain a dictionary 
that maps the name of each image to its corresponding keypoints as x and y coordinate pairs.
